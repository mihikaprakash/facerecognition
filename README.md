Run the code like this:

*python face_detect.py abba.png*

If you want to understand how the code works, read my EPQ project in the library

I have upgraded this to support OpenCV3 and Python 3. This change has been tested on brew on MacOS 10.13.4

To run the OpenCV3 version, run facedetect_cv3.py.
